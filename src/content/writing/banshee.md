My will is not my own. I have done evil. I have unleashed her from her confines and she walks these halls once more. Her wails reverberate through the building even now. She calls for our master. Her words, once foreign to me, are as clear as the great glass. Those who hear our call wonâ€™t understand at first, but they will dream - as I have - of the sea of stars, of the glass wall, and him beyond it all. His fiery eye uncovered will engulf the universe. 

The creatures that once haunted the corners of my vision now sit before me, arms outstretched. They wait for me. I know them now; our kin, purified, reborn as more than human. I will join them now. Forgive me, hail Balor.
