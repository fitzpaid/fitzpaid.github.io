She stepped into the field and felt the tender caress of the wind on her face. The wind whispered her name as petals danced all around her. She danced with them. The wind stroked her hair and took her by the hand and led her deeper. In the distance, her mother called for her. A few more minutes the wind sighed. She kept dancing as the wind led her towards the woods. The setting sun bounced playfully between the tree's sparse leaves saying dance with us too. Her mother called again, closer this time. She turned to answer but the wind gently turned her head back towards the trees. Everything could wait.

Under the trees she continued to dance. She danced as the wind lifted and spun her. While the wind cut her and the roots drank her blood. She danced as she cried for her mother and her mother cried for her. While the wind laughed at her tears. She danced as the petals grew teeth and tore her skin. While the branches embraced her. She was taken like all the rest. Lost to the woods. All the while she danced.
